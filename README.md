# Starter for the Snakemake tutorial

This is the starter pack for the tutorial [Analysis preservation using Snakemake](https://mstamenk.github.io/2017/08/snakemake-tutorial-for-data-analysts.html).

It develops the concept of **Analysis Preservation** through 4 main features greatly simplified by Snakemake:

  + Memory: store the architecture of your projects
  + Portability: share an analysis in a user-sensitive way and reproduce the results of anyone without having to read a single line of code they wrote
  + Modularity: replace the techniques developed by your colleagues with custom scripts without altering the full structure of the analysis
  +  Reproducibility: run the same analysis on different input data samples by changing a single line of code

If your project is built in a clever way, you should be able to run your complete analysis with a single command.
